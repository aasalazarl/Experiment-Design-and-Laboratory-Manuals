These are experiments for which I designed material and wrote laboratory manuals to teach the second-year honours physics course,
Phys 296 (Experimental Physics I), at the University of Alberta

Experiment 1 - Gaussian statistics using a stopwatch
Experiment 2 - The Kater pendulum: moment of inertia and the value of g (acceleration of gravity)
Experiment 3 - Single slit diffraction and Babinet's principle: determining the thickness of a hair
Experiment 4 - Bubble chamber: energy and momentum conservation
Experiment 5 - Spectrometry and Rydberg's constant
Experiment 6 - Molecular speed: determining the speed of an evaporating molecule of isopropyl alcohol
Experiment 7 - Malus' Law: polarization
Experiment 8 - Solar collector: determining the sun's irradiance
